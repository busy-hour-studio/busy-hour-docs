# Getting Started

In this section, we will show you how to start using Busy Hour API through our Node Js SDK.

## Prerequisites

1. Busy Hour Account ([Sign Up](https://busyhour.id/auth/sign-up) if you don't have one yet)
2. Create a Busy Hour Project from the [Dashboard/Projects](https://busyhour.id/dashboard/projects)
3. Generate an API Key from the [Dashboard/Projects](https://busyhour.id/dashboard/projects)

## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
```bash

npm i @busy-hour/node

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">
```bash

yarn add @busy-hour/node

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
```bash

pnpm add @busy-hour/node

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up

To start using the Busy Hour API from NodeJs SDK, you need to import the `BusyHourNode` class from `@busy-hour/node` package. The class itself takes an object as an argument that contains the API key. For more information, you can refer to the code snippet below.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { BusyHourNode } from '@busy-hour/node';

// Create an instance of BusyHourNode with your API key (Master/Project)
// highlight-start
const nodeSdk = new BusyHourNode({
  apiToken: 'your-api-token',
});
// highlight-end

```
