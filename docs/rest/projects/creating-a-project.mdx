# Creating a Project

:::danger
Project creation is only available with a Master API Key or through the [Dashboard/Projects](https://busyhour.id/dashboard/projects).
Since a Master API Key is the API Key with the highest permission level, please hide it securely so no one can access it directly.

In this section, we will show you how to create a Busy Hour Project.

## Creating a Project

To create a Busy Hour Project, you will need to use the `POST` method pointing to `/v1/projects`. The request itself accepts the following properties:

| Property      | Type                | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `name`        | `string`            | The name of the project        |
| `description` | `string` (optional) | The description of the project |

### Quick Example

```curl
curl -H "x-busy-key: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Project"
  }' \
  -X POST https://api.busyhour.id/v1/projects
```
