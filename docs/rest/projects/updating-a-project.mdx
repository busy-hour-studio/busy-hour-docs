## Updating a Project

:::warning
You only can update a Busy Hour Project with any Master API Key or a Project API Key that generated specificly for the project you want to update.
:::

To update a Busy Hour Project, you will need to use the `PATCH` method pointing to `/v1/projects/{projectId}` with the `projectId` is the ID of the project you want to update. The request itself accepts the following properties:

| Property      | Type                | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `name`        | `string`            | The name of the project        |
| `description` | `string` (optional) | The description of the project |

### Quick Example

```curl
curl -H "x-busy-key: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "New Project Name",
    "description": "New Project Description"
  }' \
  -X PATCH https://api.busyhour.com/v1/projects/{projectId}
```
